What is the DOM?

The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

Core DOM - standard model for all document types
XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

The HTML DOM is an Object Model for HTML. It defines:

-> HTML elements as objects
-> Properties for all HTML elements
-> Methods for all HTML elements
-> Events for all HTML elements

The HTML DOM is an API (Programming Interface) for JavaScript:

JavaScript can add/change/remove HTML elements
JavaScript can add/change/remove HTML attributes
JavaScript can add/change/remove CSS styles
JavaScript can react to HTML events
JavaScript can add/change/remove HTML events
