<body>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
    </script>

<!-- 
    In the example above, getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property.

    
    
The getElementById Method

The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.

In the example above the getElementById method used id="demo" to find the element.

   

The innerHTML Property

The easiest way to get the content of an element is by using the innerHTML property.

The innerHTML property is useful for getting or replacing the content of HTML elements.

The innerHTML property can be used to get or change any HTML element, including <html> and <body>.
